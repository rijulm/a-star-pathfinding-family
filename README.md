# a-star-pathfinding-family
This repository is part of my work for the Melbourne Space Program. In this repository I have implemented variations of the a-start pathfinding algorithm. The purpose is to compare efficiency metrics and have a code base variations.

# Compared Algorithms 
1. Base A-Star 
2. Simplistic Bidirectional A-Star 

More algorithms under progress.
