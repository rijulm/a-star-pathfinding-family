# A-Star Pathfinding Algoirthm & Variations 
This repository is part of my work for the Melbourne Space Program. In this repository I have implemented variations of the a-start pathfinding algorithm. The purpose is to compare efficiency metrics and have a code base variations.

# Compared Algorithms 
1. Base A-Star 
2. Simplistic Bidirectional A-Star 
3. Weighted A* 

More algorithms under progress. 

# Implemented Heuristics 
1. Euclidian Heuristic 
2. Manhattan Distance 
3. Diagonal Distance 

# Metrics 

Under progress 

# Running instructions
